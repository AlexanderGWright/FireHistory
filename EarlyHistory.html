				For thousands of years, people have been using fire to warm themsevles, cook their food, and soften metals so they could be hammered or cast into new and useful shapes.
				However, they have also known that fire has the potential to injure and kill them and their livestock as well as to destroy their crops and homes.
				Wherever buildings were clustered together, a fire sarting in one building could and often did spread to the building next to it and the ones beyond that until
				most or all of the adjacent buildings were destroyed. Because of this potential for destruction, villages, towns, and cities throughout the Near East, Europe, 
				Scandinavia,, and Britain began to require their citizens to keep a ladder long enough to reach the roof and containers (earthen jars or wooden buckets or barrels)
				of water on hand with which to extinguish  any uncontrolled fire. These measures continued to be required of building occupants for centuries, not just in the Old 
				World, but also in North America. In fact, these measures were required of homeowners in North America as as the early twentieth century.

				As the people of the Old World evolved from nomadic tribes of shepards or hunter/gatheres into more stable agrarian societies, they built more more substantial
				structures in which to live and protect their livestock. Even though most of the buildings were constructed with walls of rock or other amterials that wouldn't burn,
				most of the roofs  were covered with thatched straw. Many of these buildings also had fireplaces for heating and cooking. Sparks from the fireplace chimneys would
				sometimes land on the dry thatch and ignite it. This happened so often that in Germany fires starting in thatched roofs came to be called "der rote Hahn" or "the 
				Red Hen". Unfortunately, the means of extinguishing uncrontrolled fires fires had not evolved beyond the bucket brigade in which people  stood side by side in a 
				line from a well or other water source to the burning building and passed buckets of water from one person to the next. The last person in line would throw the 
				water onto the fire. This crude method would sometimes work; more foten than not, however, the roof would burn off and the fire would consume most or all of 
				what was inside the building.

				When the pilgrims and others immigrated to North America starting in the seventeenth century, they brought with them the construction and firefighting methods
				of the countries they elft behind. Unfortunately, the results were also similiar. It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution  beginning in the last quarter of the 
				eighteenth century that fire fighting tools, equipment, and methods began to change in North America.<br><br>
				The industrial revolution affected many aspects of society, but especially the textile and steel industries. Textile mills sprang up in North America, particularly 
				in the New England states. These mills produced cotto and linen cloth along with tremendous quantities of highly flammable lint and other debris that accumulated on
				and under the oiled wooden floors of these amssive mill buildings. Because most of these buildings were lighted by oil lamps and eventually gas lights, sources of 
				ignition were numerous. Even though mill buildings were usually constructed of brick and heavy timber, fires in these occupancies were frequent and sometimes
				catastrophic. However, the revolution in the iron and steel industries began to produce fire fighting tools and equipment - especially pumping apparatus - that would
				make fighting fires in textile mills ad simial occupancies feasible. These early pumpers and ladder trucks evolved into the modern fire apparatus that we see today.

				It was during this period that cities and towns in North America began to organize fire companies and fire departments to protect them from the ravages of fire.
				These groups often evolved from organized social and fraternal clubs devoted tofighting fires. Among the first of these was a group organized by Benjamin Franklin 
				in Philadelphia, PA. Franklin also founded the first successful fire insurance company in North America, which he called Philadelphia Contributorship. This and
				other early insurance companies supported local the local fire comapnies. The various companies adopted distinctive symbols - known as fire marks -  and posted one 
				on each property they protected.<br><br>
				Many of the early fraternal groups were made up of military veterans and the organizations adopted that rank structure, such as privates, corporals, sergeants,
				lieutenants, captains, and majors, with which their members were most familiar. Some fire departments today still use thsoe ranks, but the majority of departments,
				now use different designations except for the ranks of lieutenant and captain. Then, as today, the majority of firefighters in North America were volunteers.
				<br><br>
				The members of these organizations were very proud of their work and many became quite competitive - so much so that members of different groups arriving at the scene
				of a fire at the same time would sometimes fight each other for the right to fight the fire. As competitive and soemtimes combative as these groups were, they eventually
				evolved into the volunteer and career departments that protect our cities and towns today.

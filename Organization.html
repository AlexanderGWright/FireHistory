				To function effectively as a member of a team, memebers operate according to the following four basic organizational principles:<br>
				<br>&#8226;Unity of command
				<br>&#8226;Span of controls
				<br>&#8226;Division of labor
				<br>&#8226;Discipline<br><br>

			<p class="ColumnStyle">
				Unity of command.  This means that members only report to one sueprvisor. Directly, each subordinate reports to one boss; indirectly, however, everyone reports to the
				fire chief through the chain of command. The chain of command represents the lines of authority and responsibility from the highest level of the department to the lowest.

			<p class="ColumnStyle">
				Span of control. This means that any offcier can effectively supervise or manage only a certain number of individuals or groups. A rule of thumb in the fire service 
				is that an officer can directly supervise three to seven firefighters effectively, with five being optimum, but the actual number can vary with the situation.
				Likewise a chief officer can manage the same number of fire companies.

				Division of labor. This is the process of dividing large jobs into small jobs to make them more manageable. For example, if a multistory building needs to be 
				searched, each floor may be assigned to a different fire company. In that way, each company has a reasonable workload and the entire building is searched quickly.
				Small jobs may then be broken down further and assigned to specific individuals. Division of labor is necessary for the following reasons:<br>
				<br>&#8226;To assign responsiblity
				<br>&#8226;To prevent duplication of effort
				<br>&#8226;To make specific and clear-cut assignments

				Discipline. In this context, discipline refers to both an organization's responsability to provide the direction needed to satisfy it's identified goals and
				objectives and the individual's responsability to follow the direction given. In other words, discipline is setting the limits or boundries for expected 
				perfmance and enforcing them. This direction may come in the forms of rules, regulations, or policies, but regardless of the term used, it mus define acceptable 
				performance and expected outcomes. The rules of the department must be clearly written and disseminated throughout the organization.

				Fire Companies.
				The standard operating unit of a fire department is the fire
				company commonly referred to as just a company), which
				is a group of firefighters assigned to a particular piece of fire
				apparatus or to a particular station. In most fire departments
				(but not all) a company consists of a company officer, a driver
				operator, and one or more firefighters 
				A fire company is organized, equipped, and trained for
				definite functions. The functions and duties of similar fire
				companies may vary in different localities because of the in
				inherent hazards of the area, the size of the department, and
				the scope of the department's activities. A small fire depart
				ment may have only one fire company to carry out all of
				the functions that normally would be performed by several
				companies in a larger fire department. The following lists the emergency tasks. Courtesy
				general descriptions of fire companies
				<br>
				• Engine company-Deploys hoselines for fire attack and exposure protection
				<br>

				• Truck (ladder) company Performs forcible entry, search and rescue, ventilation
				salvage and overhaul, and utilities control and provides access to upper levels of a
				structure 
				<br>
				• Rescue squad/company Searches for and removes victims from areas of danger
				or entrapment and may perform technical rescues 
				• Brush company Extinguishes wildland fires and protects structures in the
				wildland/urban Interface 
				<br>
				• Hazardous materials company - Responds to and mitigates hazardous materials
				Incidents 
				<br>
				• Emergency medical/ambulance company - Provides emergency medical care to
				patients (may provide transportation to a medical facility) 
				<br>
				• Special rescue company - Responds to and performs technical rescues
